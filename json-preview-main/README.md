## Why I started this project

I came across a code editor that helps you visualize JSON file, so I thought about build something similar as a web app with additional features.

I had a challenges with generating the diagram, but `Reactflow` gave me insight on how to connect the different nodes and edges together. 

## How It Works

Users can easily interact with the code editor and type in JSON structured code.

The code editor has a *debugging feature* - red indicator that shows error exist in the code. Thus, It can't be previewed until it is fixed.

At the bottom-left, it has features which allows:

- **Zoom in or out** from the workspace.
- **Fit to view** for easy switching on the vertical or horizontal direction.
- **Lock** to restrict the diagram generated from further edit or distortion.

At the top-right, there is:

- **Download** to the diagrams
- **Orientation adjustment** button for custom view.


The left side menu consists of:

- **Eraser** to delete the contents in the code editor.
- **Social media handles** (Linkedin, Twitter)
- **Github repository**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ugwustanley/json-preview.git
```

2. Change the working directory

```bash

```

3. Install dependencies
